# Face_Detection_HAARCASCADE
An python application to detect faces .

In this application there are mainly 3 phases
         -Dataset Collection
         -Dataset Training
         -Detection of faces

We have used OpenCV , NumPy , Haarcascade_Classifier

A Haar-like feature considers adjacent rectangular regions at a specific location in a detection window, 
sums up the pixel intensities in each region and calculates the difference between these sums. 
This difference is then used to categorize subsections of an image.
